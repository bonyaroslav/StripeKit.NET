# StripeKit.NET
StripeKit.NET is a minimal .NET toolkit for integrating or fixing Stripe Payments/Billing in real production apps. It focuses on the failure modes that cost money: duplicate operations from retries, webhook verification issues, and billing state drift. Includes a tiny sample API, tests, and an optional reconciliation job to backfill missed events.
